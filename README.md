# AOS-2

## AOS 2 is the newest version of AOS. To find the first version, go [here](https://github.com/Nanobot567/AOS-1)

# ABOUT

AOS is an open-source OS created and produced by Nanobot567. It is made in Python 3.7 and coded in Visual Studio Code.


### Since this is the second version, it's a lot bigger and has a file size of a whopping 469 KB. AOS 1 has 11 KB.

# RUNNING AOS 2

Download AOS to your desktop. Then, run it in [Python's IDLE](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or a compatible Python executer. 

Some computers already have python installed, but not IDLE. To check this, type this into your command line:

#### Mac

```
    $ python -V
```

#### Windows

```
    > python --version
```

#### Linux

```
    > python
```

An easier way to run it would be through a repl such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). Just copy-paste the code into the box on the left.

### Sidenote: I stopped working on GAMES and APPS to add them to AOS 3 :)
