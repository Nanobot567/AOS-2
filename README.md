# AOS-2

## AOS 2 is now archived. Please head over to [AOS-GUI](https://github.com/AOS-GUI/AOS-GUI/) to get the latest version of AOS!

# ABOUT

AOS is an open-source OS created and produced by Nanobot567. It is made in Python 3.7 and coded in Visual Studio Code.


### Since this is the second version, it's a lot bigger and has a file size of a whopping 469 KB. AOS 1 has 11 KB.

# RUNNING AOS 2

Download AOS to your desktop. Then, run it in [Python's IDLE](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or a compatible Python executer. 

Some computers already have python installed, but not IDLE. To check this, type this into your command line:

#### Mac

```
    $ python -V
```

#### Windows

```
    > python --version
```

#### Linux

```
    > python
```

### Sidenote: I stopped working on GAMES and APPS to add them to AOS 3 :)
